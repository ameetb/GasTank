# GasTank

GasTank is an android app that allows users to keep track of their gas consumption and provide a precise measurement of gas remaining.
GasTank can be used by owners of cars with broken fuel gauges, or by drivers who simply want a precise, numerical estimate of the gas
remaining in their tank, since many cars are only equipped with a gauge that gives drivers a rough estimate. 

This android app uses GPS to determine distance traveled and calculate gas used. It stores the amount of gas and other information in 
an sqlite database so users only have to open the app just before they start driving. It also allows users to store and keep track of
multiple cars' gas levels.

The app is currently functional, but still contains a few bugs that will soon be resolved.
